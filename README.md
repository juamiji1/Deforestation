## Overview
This project examines how political dynamics shape environmental outcomes in Colombia, focusing on Regional Environmental Protection Agencies (REPAs). Using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) based on close mayoral elections, we find that when governors and mayors are politically aligned, *deforestation increases by about 60%*â€”especially where political actors dominate agency boards and around election years. Despite higher forest loss, *no gains in local income or public investment* are observed, suggesting that forests are being lost without broader social benefits. The findings highlight how institutional design can leave environmental governance vulnerable to political capture, underscoring the need for stronger safeguards.

## Code Organization
All scripts are stored within the `/code` directory:  
- *Stata do-files:* located in `/code/do-files`  
- *Python notebooks:* located in `/code/python-scripts`  

Each file name begins with a numeric prefix indicating its role in the analysis pipeline:

| Prefix | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| `0_` | Master pipeline coordination |
| `1_` | Data preparation and cleaning |
| `2_` | Descriptive analysis and RDD assumptions |
| `3_` | Main estimations |
| `4_` | Robustness checks and extensions |
