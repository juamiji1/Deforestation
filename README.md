## Overview
This project examines how political dynamics shape environmental outcomes in Colombia, focusing on Regional Environmental Protection Agencies (REPAs).  
Using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) based on close mayoral elections, we find that when governors and mayors are politically aligned, **deforestation increases by about 60%**â€”especially where political actors dominate agency boards and around election years.  

Despite higher forest loss, **no gains in local income or public investment** are observed, suggesting that forests are being lost without broader social benefits.  
The findings highlight how institutional design can leave environmental governance vulnerable to **political capture**, underscoring the need for stronger safeguards.

## Reproduction Guide
1. Clone the repository and pull the latest version.  
2. Mirror the Dropbox structure shown above.  
3. Authenticate with Google Earth Engine.  
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks to generate satellite indicators.  
5. Execute Stata scripts starting from `0_JEEM_master.do`.  
6. Export tables and plots for Overleaf.

> **Tip:** The full pipeline is data-intensive. Avoid running all scripts sequentially; process by section as needed.
